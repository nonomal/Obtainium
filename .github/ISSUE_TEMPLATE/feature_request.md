**Prerequisites**
<!-- Please ensure your request is not part of an existing issue. -->
<!-- Please ensure you have checked the Obtainium Wiki. -->

**Describe the feature**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

For new Sources, please ensure:
1. It is not already possible to use the HTML Source for your purposes.
2. It must be possible to extract the following details from the Source in a reliable way:
- The App version (or any release-specific identifier - a "pseudo-version") for the latest release
- One or more APK URL(s) for the latest release
- Above details for previous releases (optional)

If you're not sure about 1 or 2, open a discussion item instead.
Note that the Web scraper cannot deal with JavaScript-enabled content. -->

**Describe alternatives you've considered (if applicable)**
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

Note that app-specific Sources are less likely to be added. In those cases, see if the HTML Source will work for you (if not, see if a generally-applicable enhancement to the HTML Source would work, and suggest that instead). -->

**Additional context**
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->
